#To Do
Contributions on any of these are more than welcome.

##Usability
* Create the `makepkg-shim.sh` script for building on other distros.

##Transmission Server
* Currently using the `ffmpeg` binary in a ugly, hackish way (due to time constraints) - look into reworking it with the corresponding libraries.
* Look into something like MPEG-TS over HTTP/2 as well as an OBS plugin to offer an alternative to (the frankly horrendous) RTMP protocol. Not actually MPEG-TS, but something which isn't limited to codecs specified in the spec.
