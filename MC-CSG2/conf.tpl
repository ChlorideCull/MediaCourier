    <p>
        Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
        <br />
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
        <br />
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
        <br />
        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
        <br />
        &quot;'Tis some visiter,&quot; I muttered, &quot;tapping at my chamber door—
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this and nothing more.&quot;
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
        <br />
        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
        <br />
        Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
        <br />
        From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
        <br />
        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nameless here for evermore.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
        <br />
        Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
        <br />
        So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
        <br />
        &quot;'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door—
        <br />
        Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This it is and nothing more.&quot;
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
        <br />
        &quot;Sir,&quot; said I, &quot;or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
        <br />
        But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
        <br />
        And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
        <br />
        That I scarce was sure I heard you&quot;—here I opened wide the door;—
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkness there and nothing more.
        <br /> 
        <br />
        Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
        <br />
        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
        <br />
        But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
        <br />
        And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, &quot;Lenore?&quot;
        <br />
        This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, &quot;Lenore!&quot;—
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merely this and nothing more.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
        <br />
        Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
        <br />
        &quot;Surely,&quot; said I, &quot;surely that is something at my window lattice;
        <br />
        Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
        <br />
        Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis the wind and nothing more!&quot;
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
        <br />
        In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
        <br />
        Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
        <br />
        But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
        <br />
        Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
        <br />
        By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
        <br />
        &quot;Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,&quot; I said, &quot;art sure no craven,
        <br />
        Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
        <br />
        Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!&quot;
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth the Raven &quot;Nevermore.&quot;
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
        <br />
        Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
        <br />
        For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
        <br />
        Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
        <br />
        Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such name as &quot;Nevermore.&quot;
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
        <br />
        That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
        <br />
        Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
        <br />
        Till I scarcely more than muttered &quot;Other friends have flown before—
        <br />
        On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.&quot;
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the bird said &quot;Nevermore.&quot;
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
        <br />
        &quot;Doubtless,&quot; said I, &quot;what it utters is its only stock and store
        <br />
        Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
        <br />
        Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
        <br />
        Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of 'Never—nevermore'.&quot;
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
        <br />
        Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
        <br />
        Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
        <br />
        Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
        <br />
        What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meant in croaking &quot;Nevermore.&quot;
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
        <br />
        To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
        <br />
        This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
        <br />
        On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
        <br />
        But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shall press, ah, nevermore!
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
        <br />
        Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
        <br />
        &quot;Wretch,&quot; I cried, &quot;thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
        <br />
        Respite—respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore;
        <br />
        Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!&quot;
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth the Raven &quot;Nevermore.&quot;
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        &quot;Prophet!&quot; said I, &quot;thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
        <br />
        Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
        <br />
        Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
        <br />
        On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
        <br />
        Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!&quot;
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth the Raven &quot;Nevermore.&quot;
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        &quot;Prophet!&quot; said I, &quot;thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
        <br />
        By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
        <br />
        Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
        <br />
        It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
        <br />
        Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.&quot;
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth the Raven &quot;Nevermore.&quot;
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        &quot;Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!&quot; I shrieked, upstarting—
        <br />
        &quot;Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
        <br />
        Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
        <br />
        Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
        <br />
        Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!&quot;
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth the Raven &quot;Nevermore.&quot;
    </p>
</div>
<div class="contentbox">
    <p>
        And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
        <br />
        On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
        <br />
        And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
        <br />
        And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
        <br />
        And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be lifted—nevermore!
